    <div class="menu col-lg-4 col-md-6">
      <div class="title menu1">Carrots</div>
      <div class="description">Carrots make great snacks and add a sweet, earthy taste to soups, salads, and desserts. In fact, they just might be the perfect vegetable.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="menu col-lg-4 col-md-6">
      <div class="title menu2">Broccoli</div>
      <div class="description">Not as fashionable as kale but much more appealing to kids -- and many grown-ups -- this bright bunch, related to cauliflower and Brussels sprouts, deserves a reputation reboot. It's loaded with vitamin C, folate, and dietary fiber, and one cup of broccoli florets has all the calcium you need in a day.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="menu col-lg-4 col-md-12">
      <div class="title menu3">Eggplant</div>
      <div class="description">Eggplant comes in a range of shapes and colors. Globe eggplants are the largest and most common. The smaller Japanese eggplant is long and narrow, with fewer seeds, thinner skin, and a milder, less bitter flavor than the globe variety.</div>
